# Hi, I'm Yashika Shetty!

**Frontend-Focused Software Engineer**, currently deep-diving into full-stack development. I enjoy building clean UIs and learning how everything connects behind the scenes â€” from frontend to backend.

## Technologies I Use:
- **Frontend:** React, Angular, HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend (Learning):** Node.js (Express), MongoDB, .NET
- **Tools:** Git, Postman, VS Code, GitHub, Netlify, Render

## Projects:
- **Task Tracker (React + Node.js)** â€” A full-stack productivity app with CRUD functionality  
- **[More projects coming soon...]**

## What Iâ€™m Exploring Now:
- Backend APIs with Express  
- Full-stack workflows with React and MongoDB  
- Scalable project architecture and deployment
