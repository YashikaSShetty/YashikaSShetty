# Hi, I'm Yashika Shetty!

**Frontend-Focused Software Engineer**, currently deep-diving into full-stack development. I enjoy building clean UIs and learning how everything connects behind the scenes — from frontend to backend.

## Technologies I Use:
- **Frontend:** React, Angular, HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend (Learning):** Node.js (Express), MongoDB, .NET
- **Tools:** Git, Postman, VS Code, GitHub, Netlify, Render

## Featured Projects
